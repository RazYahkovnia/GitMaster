# GitMaster Agent Rules 

## Important
- Follow `documentation/CODE_GUIDE.md` for code instructions and project structure.
- Every change should be covered by tests.
- Changes should follow best practices without hacks.
- Every change should be shortly mentioned in `CHANGELOG.md` while bumping the version.
- If the change introduces a new big feature or changes a big feature --> update the `README.md`
- New Git operations, should implement in `src/services/git/*`, expose via `src/services/gitService.ts`, then use from commands/providers.
- Make sure to reuse functions and don't duplicate them.
- Follow best code practices.
- For each feature, if you think it can be helpful to expose it as a new tool in mcp, ask the user if he wants to.
